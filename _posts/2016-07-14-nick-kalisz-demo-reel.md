  This is my story from the past year of beauty and joy, leading into some of
  the hardships we all encounter. As in any life these hardships can lead to
  great success.

  Nick Kalisz’ film career is inspired by the great outdoors and the raw beauty
  of human emotion.

  After graduating from Ohio University’s Scripps School of Communication in
  Film and Video Production Nick migrated to Jackson Hole, Wyoming. He quickly
  realized his passion for capturing human interaction in nature. As a former
  athlete, Nick's unique ability to travel quickly, efficiently and safely in
  high alpine terrain has led him to film production around the world. From the
  Austrian Alps and high Himalayas of Nepal to remote Alaska and Mt. Kilimanjaro
  Nick has filmed commercials, television, major motion pictures and sports
  documentaries. Nick has unique talent and passion for operating premier
  production gear, implementing hollywood techniques, managing media and running
  equipment on solar in some of the most remote and harsh backcountry locations
  in the world.

  Equipment: 4k Red Digital Cinema Cameras, Phantom Camera Systems, Canon, Sony,
  DJI Inspire, DJI Ronin, Feather Light Camera Crane, Kessler Products and
  Programing, Adobe Creative Suite.
